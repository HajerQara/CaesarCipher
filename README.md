# CaesarCipher

The CaesarCipher program utilizes the concept of cryptology known as Caesar's Cipher. 

The program is able to take user input and encrypt or decrypt the text the user entered. 

The Caesar Cipher technique works by assigning the letters of the alphabet to another set of letters that are rearranged and put in a fixed number position. For example, if A is considered number 16 in the new alphabet set then B would be the 17 letter.    

NOTE: The program specifies the user uses capital letters 'E' or 'D' when choosing to encrypt or decrypt.
